## Explanation

Helped develop Pledge Class to the first deployable version with [MadeByMunsters](http://madebymunsters.com/).

## Problem

As leaders of Sororities and Fraternities grow their organizations, it becomes more and more difficult to track, each member's involvement in their university and organization.

## Solution

Pledge Class helps these organizations to stay on top of the day-to-day activities for their members.  Leaders can create events and assign point values for those activities.  Members can submit an activity for approval which results in a tally of points.

## Results

Since my contribution to Pledge Class, the app has been actively used in a small test group of universities for refinement.  It has kept those organizations that are using the application more active, and made it easier to keep up with each member.

## Conclusion

I developed Pledge Class with MadeByMunsters, a small remote team, staying connnected with daily conversations on Slack, ScreenHero, and Hangouts.  This was an exciting experience for me as I was able to learn from experts and be a large part in the making of this application.
