During my adolescent years, [Skynet](http://terminator.wikia.com/wiki/Skynet) and [The Matrix](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/) piqued my interest in software and programming.  But it wasn't until just recently that I decided to venture down this path as a career.

I have a big eagerness to learn and improve.  Especially when it comes to things that are logical, make sense and excite me.  Although this is a new venture, you have to understand, I have the drive to succeed.  Never in my professional life have I found something that I was good at and enjoyed so much.  I took a big risk getting out of a full-time job to spend that time at [Bloc](https://bloc.io) to study and improve my skills in web development.  I hope I made the right decision and see this risk pay off.
